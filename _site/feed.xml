<p>((If this blog feels too long, try using Microsoft Edge’s read aloud feature.)</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>I began learning about the stock market a year ago.  (so take this blog as  a place to jump start your knowledge, but no like this person in blind as prescription of what you should do with your money).
Objective/summary is to explain</p>
<ul>
  <li>Index funds are best, except for those read a lot and are good controlling their emotions
    <ul>
      <li>If you already know this,  feel free to skip this blog, unless you are curious about what else i have written about</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Every investment comes with risk - know what u r doing to avoid costly mistakes and save your money from ignorance</li>
  <li>Pros &amp; cons, principles, pitfalls to avoid if you decided to buy (quality ) business rather than taking index fund route</li>
  <li>I also gave links to books &amp; articles to interest you further</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="why-invest">Why invest</h1>
<h3 id="inflation-capital-preservation">Inflation (capital preservation)</h3>
<p>Inflation is the increase in prices for goods and services over time, which reduces the purchasing power of money.<br />
For example, today’s $100 is not the same as $100 in 2014; it buys less now than it did ten years ago. <br />
To preserve your current money, you need to invest it and aim for returns at least equal to the inflation rate. If your money sits idle, you lose purchasing power as prices rise regardless of what you do.</p>
<h3 id="capital-appreciation">Capital appreciation</h3>
<p>For those seeking financial independence, investing your existing capital at consistent long-term returns helps you reach your goals faster.</p>
<h1 id="investment-opportunities-and-mindset-to-have">Investment opportunities and mindset to have</h1>
<p>There are numerous ways to invest your money. While I’ll focus on the stock market, here are some other options I’m aware of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed income options:
    <ul>
      <li>Bank deposits (know if your deposit is insured, if not make sure bank wont go bankrupt),   <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money-marketfund.asp">Money Market Funds</a> (MMF) or <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp">Bonds</a></li>
      <li>Be aware whether return is going to be greater or lesser than inflation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stock market</li>
  <li>Real estate</li>
  <li>Commodities like gold</li>
  <li>Bitcoin (?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Every investment carries some risk of losing money. Preserving your capital should be foremost priority. Growing your money can be the second.</p>

<p>Have a long term mindset, Don’t rush to earn quick money. Usually, that fear of missing out (FOMO) rush will only make you lose money.</p>

<p>Remember once your money gets halved to 50% due to loss, then you need the investment to return 100% to just break even. So opt for consistent returns rather than high risk high reward investments.</p>

<p><em>Be diversified</em> -  Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification ensures that if one investment goes belly up, your life savings are still protected.</p>

<p>Good investment opportunity should also have <em>less tax burdens</em> when you eventually decide to sell your asset. Also, know the tax implications if you gift the asset to someone else (like your heir).
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taxdeferred.asp">Tax deferred investmen</a>t helps you to compound faster
Be aware of how much tax you’ll have to pay in the end. Familiarize yourself with tax-deferred accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. Understand the withdrawal rules for them and learn if they would benefit you.
	Be as tax-efficient as possible. For example, in the US, municipal bond funds and municipal bond-based money market funds are exempt from state tax whereas bank interests are not state tax exempt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t invest money that u might need within 3-5 years.  Opt for low risk bonds/bank deposits</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you invest in high risk asset with short term mindset, the asset you invested in may go down, and you would be forced to sell at a loss. 
 If you need the money within next 3-5 years, Opt for low-risk investing options like bank deposits or bonds for short-term needs.</p>

<p>With everything being digital, be sure to have unique passwords for each of your financial insitution. Use 2FA. If it makes sense (for eg in brokerages) restrict the ease of taking out the money.</p>
<h1 id="stock----slice-of-a-business-rather-than-a-random-number-generator">Stock -  Slice of a business rather than a random number generator</h1>
<p>The stock market is where people buy and sell businesses, similar to how tomatoes are sold in a vegetable market. A seller quotes a price, and when a buyer agrees, they exchange cash, and the tomato is sold. Stocks are traded similarly via the stock exchange with help of brokerages, with prices fluctuating every microsecond.</p>

<p>Businesses are divided into smaller units called shares, which are traded because not everyone can afford to buy an entire business.
Share prices are influenced by fear and greed, making them unpredictable in the short term. However, over the long term (5-10 years), stock prices tend to follow the business’s profits. One buys a share so that they can get the profit attributable to their share of the business</p>

<p>Let me give an example using Microsoft(MSFT). <br />
There are 7.43 billion shares of MSFT, currently trading at $416.79.<br />
MSFT’s total net profit is $88.13 billion, so profit per share is $11.86.<br />
As a shareholder, you can expect this $11.86 to be given back to you.( although in reality profits would be tried to be reinvested in business so that the shareholder would get bigger profit per share).</p>

<p>Earnings yield is (earnings per share/ share price) * 100%  . Earnings yield is analogous to interest rate on a savings account, showing how much profit you earn for each dollar invested in a company’s stock. <br />
The earnings yield of MSFT is $11.86 / $416.79 = 2.84%. So 2.84% of money you invested can be returned to you as part of profit attributable to you. However, with the US government / bank accounts offering a ~5.3% risk-free interest rate, why buy a share, it doesnt make sense right? Let me explain.</p>

<p>MSFT’s earning per share before 10 years was $2.67.<br />
Look how profit per share went from $2.67 to $11.86 in 10 years<br />
That’s the reason people are ready to buy MSFT share today. <em>Its not today’s earnings yield they are looking for, instead the one they would be getting after 10 years.</em> So overall MSFT owners believe by owning shares, they would get more money than what they would get with US gov interest rate.<br />
This process of estimating future profit and discounting it to today’s value is called Discounted Cash Flow analysis (more on this later).</p>

<p>In summary:
You own a share, so you can get part of company’s profit. Even if todays earnings yield is not good, as company grows, you expect higher earning yield for you in future.
So important thing to note is, its not enough for a company to be profitable, but it should keep growing its profit, i.e profit should become bigger and bigger</p>

<h1 id="why-index-funds-are-recommended-and-buying-your-own-stock-is-hard">Why Index funds are recommended and buying your own stock is hard</h1>
<p>For you to make profits, a company should be increasing its profit for the foreseeable future. This means management must be shrewd, the company shouldnot be disrupted by newer technologies, the field should be growing or the company’s market share within field should be growing etc etc.
How can you be sure a business will grow its profit in the future?   You need to understand the business’s sector, its customers, competitors, and the management team.  You need to read Company’s  annual report, quarterly report, earnings call and much more. And to some extent you need to read about the competitors and customers.<br />
Even after thorough research, what if you make a mistake in your analysis? What if the company loses money, its profit decreases, or remains flat? In these scenarios, you’re likely to lose money.</p>

<p>Therefore, buying a single business is not recommended. You shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket. Depending on who you ask, you might be advised to diversify by buying at least 12 to 50 companies.</p>

<p>It’s not impossible to research and buy more than 12 companies, but it’s very challenging. Is it worth your time?</p>

<p>So instead of you, having to study about businesses and pick individual business. Buying index funds are recommended</p>

<p>An index fund is an easy way to invest in  every stock of an index (like S&amp;P 500 or Nifty 50), generally in proportion of size of the company. 
Index fund is a mutual fund or ETF that aims to mirror the performance of a specific index. <br />
An index is basically a bunch of stocks selected based on certain rules (such as largest 500 companies in US). These indices are typically weighted by market capitalization.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/how_index_works.jpg" alt="An example for how index works" /></p>

<p>S&amp;P 500 index : Tracks 500 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization.<br />
Nifty 50: Represents the top 50 companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).</p>

<p>Each quarter, based on changes in market capitalization, companies are <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/index-rebalancing-7972596">added or removed from the index</a>, and weightings within the index are adjusted.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/S&amp;P500_is_not_actually_top_500.png" alt="S&amp;P500_is_not_actually_top_500.png" />
 Be sure to read about rules for inclusion and exclusion. For instance when I said S&amp;P 500 tracks largest 500 US companies, it was not factually true but more or less true.  once included in the S&amp;P 500, it’s harder to be removed, only if they meet rules of exclusion, stocks can be removed from S&amp;P 500. So even if a new company grows to become a top 500 business, one company which is already in S&amp;P 500 need to exit to allow space for this new company. And this is fine because, this rule keeps <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/021616/what-good-turnover-ratio-mutual-fund.asp">turnover ratio</a> low, hence keeping tax low</p>

<p>However Some index rules may seem illogical.. For example, the Dow Jones index includes 30 stocks weighted by stock price, which is meaningless because comparing share prices without considering share count is absurd. Companies can manipulate weightings through <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/reversesplit.asp">reverse splits</a>. Here’s a <a href="https://erikrood.com/Posts/DJIA.html">blog</a> for more explanation.</p>

<p>Similarly, Once you understand the Nasdaq-100 inclusion policy, you’ll see it’s not exactly a tech ETF as commonly believed. The Nasdaq-100 tracks the largest 100 stocks on the Nasdaq exchange. This results in excluding quality tech businesses such as Mastercard, Visa, because they are not listed in Nadaq exchange. Additionally, it excludes financial and REIT stocks. Because the Nasdaq-100 excludes many stocks, it is generally not recommended over the S&amp;P 500 or total market index funds.</p>

<p>So always know the rules for inclusion of stock, exclusion of stock and weightage rule of an index</p>

<p>The whole point of the S&amp;P 500 is that since you won’t know which sector will flourish, you include stocks from all sectors and use market cap-based weighting.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/S&amp;P_stocks_over_20years.png" alt="S&amp;P_stocks_over_20years.png" />
Over time, inclusion and exclusion automatically push out degrading companies and add new growing companies to the index. In the image above, If you look at top 10 stocks of 2010 and 2023, it would be clear. Look how Exonn mobil had the largest weightage during 2010 but its nowhere in top 10 of 2023.  Nasdaq-100 will be less efficient in doing this than S&amp;P 500.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of index funds, like thematic ETFs (e.g., ETFs for tech stocks, ETFs for semiconductor stocks) and 2x or 3x leveraged ETFs. Avoid them. The former doesn’t provide enough diversification, and the latter uses leverage, so if the index falls 33% in a day, a 3x leveraged ETF goes to zero, and you lose all your hard-earned money.</p>

<p>Go for large indexes with diversified businesses. If you are in the US, S&amp;P 500 or total market index funds are recommended. If you are in India, Nifty 50 index funds are recommended.</p>

<p>There would be different index funds tracking the same S&amp;P 500 index. With all else equal, go for the lowest expense ratio. For example, SPY and VOO both track the S&amp;P 500, but SPY has a 0.06% expense ratio, while VOO has a 0.03% expense ratio. So, going with VOO makes sense.</p>

<p>The expense ratio of an index fund is the annual fee that investors pay to cover the fund’s operating expenses. For instance, if an index fund has an expense ratio of 0.05%, you pay $5 annually for every $10,000 invested (doesnt matter if you had profit or not that year)</p>

<p>Buying index funds is called passive investing, because index fund passively tries to replicate the index. Active funds (where a person picks stocks for the fund rather than following fixed rules like an index) are statistically not recommended. 
<img src="http://localhost:4000/images/active_fund_sucks.jpg" alt="active_fund_sucks.jpg " />
Due to high fees and less tax efficiency, most active funds lose to passive  index fund returns over the long term. As you can see in the image taken from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FluentInFinance/comments/19379w0/94_of_active_fund_managers_do_not_beat_the_market/">source</a>.  86% of active underperformed their benchmark indexes.  How would know which active fund can beat index fund over long term? Sticking with index fund is safer!</p>

<p>If your investing strategy is anything other than index funds,  in my opinion, you need to have well informed reasoning. The reason cannot be just wanting higher returns, as higher returns are associated with higher risk (of losing money).</p>

<p>Low-cost, well-diversified index funds have statistically given the highest possible return for the least effort and least risk.</p>

<p>In summary, In US markets buy a low cost S&amp;P 500 (eg VOO) or US whole market (eg VTI) index. In India, buy low cost Nifty 50 index.</p>

<p>“It is not uncommon for three-quarters of the index’s return to be linked to only 50 to 75 stocks.” - <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/08/find-stocks-in-sp500.asp#:~:text=S%26P%20500%20Calculation,-The%20S%26P%20500&amp;text=As%20a%20result%2C%20the%20more,only%2050%20to%2075%20stocks.">Investopedia</a></p>

<p>While it’s very hard to consistently pick great businesses, it’s not impossible. However, the effort and knowledge required are so significant that, in my opinion, if you choose this route, it should be your first priority in life.</p>

<p>Initially, I had decided not to write this section to avoid distracting someone from buying index funds. But if someone can go from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1enl9hi/from_zero_to_olympic_gold_in_just_7_years/">From zero to Olympic gold in just 7 years </a>, then who am I to decide what you can or cannot do with your money?</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a born genius to excel at stock picking; you just need to take one step in the right direction consistently. If you can compound in the right direction, then you am only going to get better.</p>

<p>Don’t wish you were Naruto or Sasuke. Be Guy Sensei. Naruto (although unknown initially) &amp; Sasuke had power right from birth. Guy sensei, started as zero, kept compounding his effort, to become most powerful shinobi 💪🏻 and got acknowledged by Madara.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/guy_sensei.gif" alt="Guy sensei gif" /></p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
  <li>Someone buying great business which can grow its revenue in double digits for next 2 decades is a great feat. The skills attained during this process should be transferable to other parts of life.
    <ul>
      <li>Personally, I get attracted to doing hard things; maybe you do too.</li>
      <li>“Investing isn’t just a process of wealth creation; it is a source of great happiness and sheer intellectual delight for the truly passionate investor.” - gautam baid</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Picking a diverse set of quality businesses at a good price can consistently beat average market returns.  In long term even 1% makes a difference
    <ul>
      <li>$10000 compunded at 10% for 30 years results in $174,494.02. Whereas 11% compounding results in $228,922.97 (longer the time period, more pronounced difference)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
  <li>Statistics are not on your side.</li>
  <li>You are signing up to reading a lot and you could still underperform the market.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are picking a business then you have to read (atleast, per business) 4 quarterly reports, 4 earnings call, 1 annual report, all the interviews given by Company’s c suite. You also have to keep reading about the industry in which the business is in (ideally u want the industry to grow, and the business to grow even faster than industry, taking market share), while also tracking how the competitors are doing and also how the customers are doing.</p>

<h3 id="basic-terms-introduction">Basic Terms introduction</h3>

<p><strong>Revenue</strong> :   total amount of money a business makes from selling its products or services.<br />
<strong>Gross profit</strong> :  money a business makes after subtracting the cost of making and selling its products or services i.e revenue - cost of goods<br />
<strong>Operating Expense</strong> (Opex) : day-to-day costs of running a business. Think of it as the money you spend to keep the lights on and the business running smoothly<br />
<strong>Capital Expense</strong> (Capex) : expenses that would give revenue over the next years. Eg - expense of buying a factory<br />
Note: While Opex affects net profit directly, Capex does not. Capex goes into the balance sheet as an asset. Over time, it gets subtracted from the income statement as depreciation (for tangible assets) or amortization (for intangible assets).<br />
<strong>Net Profit</strong>: Accounting profits (Company doesnt necessarily receive this amount as cash in hand).<br />
Can be calculated as,<br />
	Net Profit = Revenue - (Cost of goods sold + Operating expense + Depreciation/Amortisation + Interest expense + Income tax)<br />
Using accounting techniques, net profit can be legally manipulated to achieve a certain value. However, in the long term, any manipulation will revert back. Keep in mind that short-term net profit can be manipulated, so Free Cash Flow (FCF) is a good metric to watch for.  <br />
<strong>FCF</strong> (Free cash flow):  This is the cash a business has left over after paying for its operating expenses and capital expenditures. Its the cash profit the company has in hands.<br />
<strong>PE ratio</strong>:
Price per share / Earnings per share.<br />
It’s like seeing how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. <br />
A high P/E might mean the stock is overvalued, or investors expect high growth.<br />
<strong>P/FCF ratio</strong> : Similar to PE ratio, but with wrt FCF instead of net profit.<br />
<strong>Earnings yield</strong> :as we have already seen The percentage of profit attributable to one share relative to the price of that share.<br />
<strong>ROIC</strong> : profits/ invested capital. What percentage of invested capital is generated as profit. Indicates efficiecy of the company<br />
<strong>ROE</strong> : profits/equity. Be careful, it can be elevated by using higher leverage (liability)<br />
<strong>Equity</strong> = Asset - Liability from Balance sheet<br />
<strong>Dilution</strong> : 
Phenomeon where companu issues more share. This is bad for shareholders. because they buy shares based on Earning per share (EPS). If profit stays the same but number of shares increases, then EPS reduces.  It’s like adding more water to a soup, making each bowl less concentrated.<br />
Dilution happens when business pays their employees with stock. They can also issue stock during acquisition or with convertible notes https://learn.angellist.com/articles/convertible-note<br />
Dilution as such is not bad, if profits can out grow the share increases<br />
Because of dilution, always look at EPS or FCF/share rather than Net profit or FCF<br />
<strong>Buyback</strong> : 
Company buys back its own shares from the market.Essentially opposite of dilution. reducing share count, so EPS increases. hence value of share now increases.<br />
This is one way of returning money to shareholders. More tax efficient than dividend.<br />
<strong>Dividend</strong>:<br />
Company’s earnings distributed to shareholders, usually in cash. This is another way of returning money to shareholders. You have to pay tax for dividend.<br />
Is dividend good? Dont buy a stock just for dividend, money is returned to shareholder means, there is no other good way to reinvest, so that means profit wont be growing much over long term.</p>

<p><em>Overall profit you may get holding a share maybe attributable</em> to</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earnings growth (which can be via organic growth or via M&amp;A)</li>
  <li>Valuation ratio growth (think PE ratio or P/FCF ratio),</li>
  <li>Dividend yield ,</li>
  <li>Buyback yield</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most metrics can be legally manipulated if desired. so never rely on a single metric</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just like how two eyes are needed for depth perception, use multiple metrics to gain a clearer understanding of a company’s true profitability and growth.</p>

<p>A quality business is one that you never have to sell and keeps compounding. Some good books on this topic are “100 Baggers,” “Quality Investing,” and “The Little Book That Still Beats the Market.” (links given below)</p>

<p><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>High Return on Investment:</strong> A business with a return on investment (ROIC or ROCE) (above 15%?)</li>
  <li><strong>Reinvestment:</strong> A business that can keep reinvesting in itself at a high rate.</li>
  <li><strong>Good Management:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Execution</strong>: Ability to executes what they had promised earlier (its not always easy to do as you promise)</li>
      <li><strong>Capital Allocation:</strong> Finding the best use of capital via organic growth, mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A), buybacks, or dividends to maximize value for shareholders.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Being honest and not overpromising.</li>
      <li><strong>Shareholder-Centric:</strong> Ensuring shareholders benefit, focusing on growth, and giving back to shareholders.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Competitive Advantage (Moat):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A business should not be easily disrupted by newcomers and should have a competitive advantage (moat). Even after 10 years, the business should be growing profitably.</li>
      <li>Generally, a higher profit margin compared to competitors indicates pricing power (a competitive advantage). However, this is not the only indicator. For example, Costco has low margins but passes the savings to customers, which itself is a moat, because customers will keep returning to Costco.
        <ul>
          <li>Again, no single metric cannot be relied upon
          <img src="http://localhost:4000/images/Costco_gross_margin.png" alt="Costco gross margin comparisionf" /></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><em>Important thing to keep in mind is moat either keeps growing or reducing over time. it doesn’t stay the same</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The business you buy need not be complex or a tech company. Any company that can keep growing its profit and has a reasonable initial pricing ratio can provide good returns.</p>

<p>“This is not like Olympic diving where they have a ‘degree of difficulty’ factor. You get paid just as well for the most simple dive, as long as you execute it all right. And there’s no reason to try those three-and-a-halfs when you get paid just as well for just diving off the side of the pool and going in cleanly.” - Warren Buffett</p>

<p>Examples: Monster, Domino’s Pizza are simple businesses which gave great returns</p>

<h3 id="how-i-would-start-reading-about-a-business">How I would start reading about a business</h3>

<p>I would listen to 2-3 earnings call to infer what are the terms being used. Then try to understand quarterly report (10Q). After that read annual report. Initial days of reading a business, I would have absolutely no clue what is being talked, but over time, dots get connected and I will understand decent amount of details (only to find that this business is not that great😪 )</p>

<h3 id="valuation-and-when-to-buy-a-stock">Valuation and when to buy a stock:</h3>
<p><strong>Simple valuation ratios</strong>:
Obviously best time to buy something is when its cheaper. You can simply compare current valuation ratios (such as PE, P/FCF, EV/EBITDA, PS) to past values or to its comeptitors to come to an conclusion about its valuation. But it doesnt exactly tell if stock is actually undervalued, it only tells relative valuation compared to its past or present competitors</p>

<p><strong>Discounted Cash Flow</strong> (DCF): 
This involves estimating the Free Cash Flow (FCF) per share of a business over the long term, potentially until eternity. You sum up these future cash flows and discount them to today’s value to get a fair value of a share. However, the result can vary significantly based on your estimates of FCF growth and the discount rate you use. estimating FCF growth is quite complex and may be unrealistic for a beginner to attempt. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8E64j-2pvc">The DCF Model Explained - YT</a></p>

<p><strong>Reverse DCF</strong>: 
More meaningful, especially in the early years of your investing journey. Instead of determining the fair value of a share, you start with the current share price and work backward to determine what FCF growth is implied by that price. From there, you decide whether that FCF growth is realistic or not. This approach is more practical for beginners, in my opinion. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3TPScYBK5s&amp;t=25s">Reverse DCF explained - YT</a></p>

<p><strong>Efficient market theory</strong> suggests that all available information is already reflected in stock prices. Meaning stock can never be over or undervalued. In a way, Narrative or stock growth determines price. While a news which can be pain to business over short term, but over long term (based on your knowledge on business, management etc) you may consider the news to be not that negative. Hence the stock maybe efficiently priced as per the news (but in your perspecitve the news is not that negative), so in your perspective the stock looks undervalued.</p>

  <p>You want great businesses that are having temporary problems.</p>

<p>In my opnion,  risk of owning individual stocks, can be reduced to certain extent if u diversify enough and if u know hell lot about the company</p>

<h3 id="good-mindset-to-have">Good mindset to have</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Remember, it’s very easy to lose money when buying your own stock. Buying stocks is not a get-rich-quick affair! Safety first; don’t try to race to your first million.</li>
  <li>Picking stocks is about rejecting businesses. You are looking to say no, not yes.</li>
  <li>Minimize the chance of losing money. Always read and ensure there’s a very low chance of losing money. Look for an unfair advantage where you can win big and lose less money. If you take care of the downside, the upside will automatically be taken care of.</li>
  <li>Confidence in your thesis. Before buying, ask yourself if you would bet on your thesis being correct. If you’re not sure, why aren’t you buying an index fund?</li>
  <li>Don’t buy in doubt. It might be hard to discard the work you’ve done, but when in doubt, don’t buy.</li>
  <li>Read extensively. Read every piece of publicly available information about a company. The more you know, the better you can estimate its growth. Reading more reduces your risk.</li>
  <li>Avoid borrowed conviction. Don’t follow social media blindly. What would you do if the stock they recommended (and you bought) falls 50% and the person stops posting about it? Do you know if you should sell, buy more, or what to do on your own?</li>
  <li>Avoid buying with borrowed money. Very risky</li>
  <li>Accept missed opportunities. Sometimes you miss the boat. Accept it, think “good for those who bought,” and move on. Hindsight bias is real. Don’t FOMO like this blind post: https://www.teamblind.com/post/Life-savings-gone-UJNTuPT8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=normal&amp;from=share_link</li>
  <li>No no-brainer investments. Picking a “too big to fail” company is not the answer. Profit growth is all that matters. For example, Intel has been too big/important to fail since the 2000s, but their profit hasn’t grown much, hence their stock price hasn’t grown much. If profit remains stagnant or even if growth reduces a bit, people might panic sell, reducing the multiple. A great example is PayPal.</li>
  <li>Every purchase has an opposite view. For every share you buy, someone is selling. Control fear and greed, and use an objective mindset.</li>
  <li>Stock down 50% doesn’t mean it’s a good buy. Maybe the stock was overvalued before, or earnings dropped, or future income is expected to grow less or shrink. If a stock went up 60% in one year, does that mean it’s overvalued? Consider future growth expectations and past valuations (cheap or costly).</li>
  <li>Stock up 200% since you bought. Does that mean you were correct? No. What matters most over the long term is the company’s revenue growth. Short-term price action, even over five years, means nothing.</li>
  <li>more points hidden under this toggle
    <ul>
      <li>Absolutely don’t buy pre-revenue companies, biomedical, airline, or even sports apparel companies. Don’t fall for the “next big thing” businesses.</li>
      <li>Don’t do intraday trading. Stay away from using leverage (F&amp;O - call, put, long, short). Leverage is the easiest way to lose all your money faster.</li>
      <li>Don’t follow stock prices; follow the net income of the stock, or better yet, follow free cash flow (FCF). Market reactions after earnings don’t always mean the earnings were bad. Read the quarterly report and form your own opinion. Yes, the market can be wrong in the short term.</li>
      <li>Form your own checklist to help your thought process.</li>
      <li>Don’t just trust CEOs’ guidance. While they can be genuine, a CEO’s job is to market their company as the best in the world. You have to read between the lines to understand what’s happening. Don’t fully assume analysts’ price targets are correct; that’s often misleading. The same goes for anyone in the news predicting doom. They can’t say for sure either.</li>
      <li>Doubt everything, but trust management enough to give them some space. Focus on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations.</li>
      <li>Keep learning, keep improving, and keep your emotions in check. Tune out the noise. Read about biases and behavioral investing flaws. Fear, greed, and capital gains taxes will always challenge you. Be wary of them. Stay calm, not greedy or fearful.</li>
      <li>Past performance doesn’t indicate future performance, but it generally forms an upper limit. If a business has been compounding at 6% a year, for it to become 10%, it needs a strong reason.</li>
      <li>You can never catch the bottom or peak. Always dollar-cost average (DCA).</li>
      <li>Read what the CEO’s salary is and what metrics are targeted for their performance stock units.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<p><em>Reading all these stuffs takes time.. be patient, don’t get overwhelmed</em></p>
<h1 id="outro">Outro</h1>

<p>Whatever your investment decision is, make an informed one. Know why you’re buying this asset (eg stock) rather than another (eg real estate, gold). Keep learning and regularly check if your thesis is still intact. Don’t be in denial if you are wrong.</p>

<p>You will always hear success stories of someone earning 1000x their money in options, Bitcoin, or Nvidia. Remember, only those who made money show off. The 99% who made similar bets and lost don’t share their stories. You only hear from the winners. 
	Please don’t YOLO your money like this person in <a href="https://www.teamblind.com/post/Life-savings-gone-UJNTuPT8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=normal&amp;from=share_link">blind</a>. Quote from the post - <em>“so I’m gonna lose 80% of my savings over the weekend. What are some ways to come back from this reset in my life? I can think of taking on an extra part time, and have at it for 20+ years</em>” This is why dviersification, long term mindset etc are important.</p>

<p>Everyone makes mistakes in their investment journey; make sure they won’t hurt you for the rest of your life. Be responsible with your money</p>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>WhatsApp was founded in 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum. In 2014, Facebook had acquired WhatsApp for 19 Billion USD. After shelling out billions for WhatsApp, Zuckerberg would obviously be trying to convert WhatsApp into his surveillance fortress, to create a better profile on you. And there have been baby steps taken towards this. But now he has taken a big step of publicly disclosing Whatsapp will share data with Facebook. But I suspect the sharing has been going on for a while, but now Zuckerberg is being forced to disclose it after Apple started forcing iOS app makers to disclose any data collection.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-policy-update">Privacy Policy update</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some of the metadata (means - data that provides information about other data) which is going to be shared with Facebook are battery level, signal strength, app version, browser information, mobile network, connection information (including phone number, mobile operator or ISP), language and time zone, IP address, device operations information, and identifiers (including identifiers unique to Facebook Company Products associated with the same device or account).</li>
  <li>In short, this update means that WhatsApp will share almost all possible metadata with Facebook which will use them to create a profile on you and show ad.</li>
  <li>I am seeing many local YouTubers mindlessly claiming, your messages are going to be read by Facebook to show you ads. Don’t worry your message content won’t be exploited here, because your messages are end to end encrypted (which means only you and the recipient, not even WhatsApp, has the password to decrypt the message you send), so Facebook or Whatsapp, at least for now, can’t read your messages.</li>
  <li>This latest change to the WhatsApp privacy policy has stirred up the whole world. Many are thinking of switching to other alternatives. With Musk tweeting on the support of signal, the app is seeing a surge in installation count. Along with signal, Telegram is also being suggested as an alternative. Let’s look at both of them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternatives-being-suggested">Alternatives Being Suggested</h3>

<h4 id="signal">Signal</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://signal.org/en/">Signal</a> app, an open-source nonprofit messaging app, is the best option for privacy among other messaging apps. There is no better alternative out there in terms of privacy and security.</li>
  <li>Fun fact - End to end encryption implemented in WhatsApp is Signal’s encryption protocol.</li>
  <li>Only practical hindrance with the signal app is there is no cloud-based backing up of your messages, so when you get a new device, you have to back up your message manually and move.</li>
  <li>There is no status feature in the signal, this may put off some people, but I personally hate status feature in any app, especially in a chatting app🤷🏻‍♂️, such a distracting thing. So I find the absence of status to be positive, but I am sure this is a negative for most of the others.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="telegram">Telegram</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Telegram is another alternative put forward by media and YouTubers as a privacy-oriented alternative.</li>
  <li>By default, Telegram chats are not end to end(e2e) encrypted. Only the secret chat feature present in telegram gets e2e encryption</li>
  <li>If signal can be considered following a minimalist approach, telegram is the straight opposite, packed with tons of features.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-opinion">My Opinion</h3>

<p>My opinion, based only on security and privacy features, will be</p>

<h4 id="switch-to-signal---best-decision">Switch to Signal - Best Decision</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The best decision you can take in terms of security and privacy. With Facebook owning WhatsApp, it’s only a matter of time before WhatsApp becomes the data mine of Facebook. If you have decided to switch I am happy and do support your decision.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="staying-in-whatsapp---its-kind-of-ok">Staying in WhatsApp - It’s Kind of OK</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Security remains good because of e2e, but your privacy takes a hit.</li>
  <li>As long as e2e is present, I am personally ok as my message content is safe and cannot be read by others ( this is just my opinion, you can take your decision based on how much you value security than privacy)</li>
  <li>So I will stay as long as e2e stays and my contacts stay, if either one goes away, then bye-bye WhatsApp👋🏻</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="switching-to-telegram---not-recommended">Switching to Telegram - Not Recommended.</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Do only if you are only going to use secret chat, which many are not going to do. Because only this type of chat is supported with e2e encryption</li>
  <li>Do note that this doesn’t mean telegram has a security flaw or if you use telegram, 3rd party is going to read your message, it’s just, in comparison to WhatsApp’s default e2e encryption, telegrams regular chat’s security is a tad bit less.</li>
  <li>But the amount of data collected by telegram seems to be less than WhatsApp (this is based on “App Privacy” details listed on Apple’s app store)</li>
  <li>So it boils down to your priority over security vs privacy. The choice is yours.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="let-me-introduce-you-to-the-actual-problem">Let Me Introduce You To The Actual Problem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The impact of the data being taken from you because of this WhatsApp update is very small when you compare how much data obtained from you when using Google search or when browsing the internet (see what every browser can know about you - <a href="https://webkay.robinlinus.com/">link</a>)</li>
  <li>Apple store recently started to educate its user with how much an app mines data on you, just see the pic below, even though WhatsApp has highest data collection among the three apps we were seeing, see how it pales away in comparison with Facebook messenger app.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/apple_labels.png" alt="apple_labels.png" /></p>

<h4 id="google">Google</h4>
<p>Let’s see how much data, Google has collected on you. Google knows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Where you have been: click <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb">here</a> to see your timeline</li>
  <li>Everything you have searched (and deleted): click <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/myactivity">here</a> to know how much of your web activities have been tracked by Google.</li>
  <li>All the apps you use: click <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions">here</a></li>
  <li>All of your YouTube history: click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history/search_history">here</a></li>
  <li>Google has created an advertisement profile for you based on the information it has collected, click <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/">here</a> to see your ad profile.</li>
  <li>If you are getting to know about these google links for the first time, then please stop, nothing else matters in the world, open these links and get awestruck on how much data Google has on you. Want to know more about the tracking by Google?, you can read further in my article <a href="https://medium.com/hackernoon/how-to-see-exactly-who-google-thinks-you-are-and-then-turn-off-their-tracking-94e83183fe36">How to See Exactly Who Google Thinks You Are — And Then Turn off Their Tracking</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="trackers-around-web">Trackers Around Web</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The websites you browse also have trackers. You are so special to the big tech companies that they want to get to know you better, even when you don’t directly use their product. So they track you throughout the net. For eg, Facebook tracks you throughout the internet building a profile for you, even though you don’t have a Facebook account.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/images/verge_trackers.png" alt="verge_trackers.png" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Nope, these are not the amount of trackers you get after browsing for one day, these trackers are from a single website, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> - a fairly popular tech website. Disturbing and shocking isn’t it.</li>
  <li>It’s not just this website, there is a high chance that almost all websites you use include at least one tracker.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>Now that you have seen about tracking throughout the web, Lets first try to</p>

<h4 id="block-trackers-throughout-the-web">Block trackers throughout the web</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Install uBlock origin which blocks ads, tracking scripts. It also comes with the added benefit of blocking ads on YouTube!!! (but this may reduce your favourite YouTuber’s income)</li>
  <li>It is available for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Chrome</a> (thereby Edge, Brave, other chromium-based browsers can use the same extension)and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox</a>. In the case of Firefox, you can install the extension in your android phone also. To know how to use the extension, see this amazing <a href="https://youtu.be/2lisQQmWQkY">explanation in YouTube</a> (note: the video may be overwhelming with tons of information - start by just installing the extension, gradually you can learn about advanced features)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="reduce-trackings-by-google">Reduce trackings by Google.</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.startpage.com/">Startpage</a>, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">Duckduckgo</a> are two good privacy alternatives for Google. For the last 2 years, I search only using either one of them. Yes, you read it right, I don’t use Google search. Although DuckDuckGo is most popular, I would suggest you try Startpage because the search results almost resemble Google results, its because Startpage takes your search query, ask the same to Google, like it’s own query and give the result to you. Startpage is like a middleman between you and Google. Why would Google accept  such a bad deal? Because Google needs to prove competitors exist during their antitrust cases, so they charge Startpage some fee and give the results to Startpage</li>
  <li>You can check the resemblance in result yourself, I have given the same query to google (search <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Whatsapp%20privacy%20update,%20should%20i%20switch%20to%20signal">link</a>) and Startpage (search <a href="https://www.startpage.com/do/dsearch?query=Whatsapp%20privacy%20update,%20should%20i%20switch%20to%20signal&amp;cat=web&amp;pl=opensearch&amp;language=english">link</a>), open these links in side by side tabs and compare the results. They will look almost the same. So if you really value your privacy, you can switch to Startpage or Duckduckgo.</li>
  <li>To stop every optional tracking done when using google products, Go to this <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols?utm_source=my-activity&amp;utm_medium=home&amp;utm_campaign&amp;continue=https%3A%2F%2Fmyactivity.google.com%2Fmyactivity%3Futm_campaign%3Dcontinue">link</a> and pause everything (but if you pause web and voice tracking then you can’t use google assistant).

</ul>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Vitamin D is said to be “Sunshine Vitamin”. Since our interaction with sunlight has reduced very much due to COVID 19 lockdown and work from home, I decided to study about what should be done get enough Vitamin D.  On reading, I found many (pre covid) studies speaking about Vitamin D deficiency spread across India (a <a href="https://www.jfmpc.com/article.asp?issn=2249-4863;year=2018;volume=7;issue=2;spage=324;epage=330;aulast=Aparna">study</a> goes to extent of calling vitamin D difficiency to be “silent epidemic”).  So I decided to share what I learnt from reading about vitamin D.</p>

<h2 id="vitamin-d-and-its-use">Vitamin D and its use:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Vitamins are essential micronutrients required by the body in small amounts for proper functioning of the body. Vitamin D is a fat soluble vitamin (meaning it dissolves in fat). Vitamin D helps in absorbing calcium and phosphorous. Therefore, It is necessary for maintaining strong bones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/vitamin-d/">article</a> by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health says “Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and reduce inflammation. Many of the body’s organs and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, which suggest important roles beyond bone health, and scientists are actively investigating other possible functions.”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="deficiency">Deficiency:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A 2014 <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/6/2/729/htm">Study</a> says that “Vitamin D deficiency prevails in epidemic proportions all over the Indian subcontinent, with a prevalence of 70%–100% in the general population”.</li>
  <li>It also goes on to say, “vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in both urban and rural settings, and across all socioeconomic and geographic strata. Vitamin D deficiency is likely to play an important role in the very high prevalence of rickets, osteoporosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and infections such as tuberculosis in India.”.</li>
  <li>If you are interested, take a look at Table 1 found in point 8 “Vitamin D Status of Ostensibly Healthy Indians” of the mentioned study, which lists data from various other studies on vitamin deficiency in India.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-much-is-required">How much is required</h2>
<p>Since I couldn’t find a recommendation by Indian government, I am listing down the details from <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer/">recommendation</a> of USA’s National Institute of health,
Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in micrograms (mcg) and International Units (IU):</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Life Stage</td>
        <td>Recommended Amount</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Birth to 12 months</td>
        <td>10 mcg (400 IU)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Children 1–13 years</td>
        <td>15 mcg (600 IU)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Teens 14–18 years</td>
        <td>15 mcg (600 IU)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adults 19–70 years</td>
        <td>15 mcg (600 IU)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adults 71 years and older</td>
        <td>20 mcg (800 IU)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Pregnant and breastfeeding women</td>
        <td>15 mcg (600 IU)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="vitamin-d-food-sources">Vitamin D Food Sources:</h2>
<p>Very few foods naturally have vitamin D. Sources include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Oily fish – such as salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel</li>
  <li>Cod liver oil</li>
  <li>Tuna fish</li>
  <li>Smaller amounts are found in egg yolks, cheese, and beef liver.</li>
  <li>Foods fortified (fortified meaning - process of adding micronutrients to food) with vitamin D</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sunlight-comes-to-the-rescue">Sunlight comes to the rescue:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Vitamin D production in the skin is the primary natural source of vitamin D. Vitamin D can be produced from cholesterol in your skin when it’s exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun. But several factors affect how much vitamin D a person’s body can make from exposure to the sun, such as time of day, geographical location, skin color, and wearing sunscreen. So there is no fixed sunlight exposure time, required to produce enough Vitamin D for the day, it varies for everyone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In general, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/radiation-the-known-health-effects-of-ultraviolet-radiation">WHO website</a> says, “There is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you! But 5 to 15 minutes of casual sun exposure of hands, face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin D levels high”</p>
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5972483/#ref6">study</a> done in Pune(India), concludes “western Indian men living in an urban setting at 18.5° N, with a dark skin (Fitzpatrick Type 5), over <em>1 h of casual sunlight exposure of the face, forearms, and hands</em> (15% skin surface area) was required (between <em>11 AM and 3 PM</em>, or scaled equivalent time), to get a minimum 1 SED-UVB dose and to maintain serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 nmol/L.” (the study considers having 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 nmol/L to be having sufficient level of vitamin D ).</li>
  <li>
    <p>The study says one hour of sunlight is required, but do note that if more skin surface (i.e if more than face, forearms, and hands) is exposed, then probably less exposure time is sufficient.  Also keep in mind that 11am to 3pm is said to be best time for sunlight exposure, because during the time period, UVB rays from sunlight is maximum. So if you are exposed to sunlight, other than this time period, then probably you might need more exposure time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although applying sunscreen is considered essential during extended exposure to sunlight, it will block the UV rays and hamper the Vitamin D production. So in order to get enough vitamin D, it is better to apply sun screen after you have got the necessary sunlight exposure</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Catching the sun’s rays in a sunny office or driving in a car unfortunately won’t help to obtain vitamin D as window glass completely blocks UVB ultraviolet light.</p>
  </li>
  <li>After reading this don’t be under sunlight longer than needed, because ultraviolet rays can cause skin cancer, it is important to <em>avoid excessive sun exposure</em>. So it is best to stay outdoors only for a limited time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fortification">Fortification:</h2>
<p>In absence of sunlight, either due to geographical location or due to winter season, you can rely on Vitamin D fortified foods (if available in your location). 
This <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/milk-fortification-india-journey-so-far">world bank blog post</a> explains the status of fortification in India,</p>
<ul>
  <li>“India lags in adopting food fortification as a scalable public health intervention.”. “To fill that gap, NDDB partnered in 2017 with the South Asia Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI), the World Bank, and The India Nutrition Initiative, Tata Trusts to explore the possibilities of large-scale milk fortification in India. “</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Over the last twelve months, this collaboration has enabled ten milk federations, dairy producer companies, and milk unions across the country to pilot milk fortification for their consumers. Fifteen others have initiated the process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A quick search in amazon shows only one brand, Nestle, offering Vitamin D fortified product, with 1 liter toned milk costing Rs 78 (at the time of writing). At this cost not everyone is going to buy the fortified milk.  Although <a href="https://ffrc.fssai.gov.in/commodity?commodity=fortified-milk#tab-faq">FAQ</a> in FSSAI’s wesbite says “Fortification of milk is relatively inexpensive and affordable and costs less than 2 paise per litre.”, India seems to have a long way to go before it produces affordable Vitamin D fortified food.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In absence of all the above vitamin D sources, one can opt for Vitamin D supplements after getting proper medical advise</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>From bargaining with vegetable vendors to convincing your parents to get you the latest iphone, life is full of negotiations. Negotiating skills are so important that no one has to convince you to learn them. This article may look long and daunting, it may insinuate you to scroll fast through the article, but as you start reading you will find most of the article is filled with interesting examples. Don’t miss out a chance to learn something which will reap benefits throughout the life. The author of this book, Chris Voss, shares valuable negotiating techniques which he had learnt throughout his career.</p>

<p>Chris has spent 24 years working in the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit. And he was the FBI’s chief international hostage and kidnapping negotiator from 2003 to 2007. At present, he is the CEO of Blackswan Ltd, founded by him after his time at FBI. He also teaches at the University of Southern California and Georgetown University.</p>

<h3 id="active-listening">Active Listening:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An important part of negotiation involves gathering information as much as possible from the counterpart and using the information to close the deal the way you want.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When your mind is occupied with thoughts on what to speak next, you will miss out valuable information spill out by the other party. So keep your mind clear when the other person is talking and listen actively. As the other party starts to talk, they subconsciously spill out bits of information crucial for the deal, For instance, liars try to talk convoluted and use pronouns like “him, they, we” to distance themselves from the lie. In short, they worry about getting caught, so they try too hard not to. Generally, more a person distances himself from an action, more important he is to that action. During a call, if a bank robber in the phone is always referring “we”, “they”, then there is a good chance that you are talking with the leader of the gang.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In short, listening is so important that it is a prerequisite for any of the below techniques to be effective.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="build-a-subconscious-bond-with-mirror">Build a Subconscious Bond with Mirror:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. Mirroring is repeating last (or critical) three words of what someone said to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your tone should be like “Please, help me understand” and then follow it with silence. <strong>Your tone and Silence is the key</strong>. With Mirror you are forcing your counterpart to rephrase, during which they spill out more information than the last time, which maybe enough for you to get the deal you wanted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The author says the only disadvantage of this technique is that people may feel awkward to use this initially, but with practice, the author claims Mirroring is very similar to Jedi mind trick”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s look at mirroring in action,</p>

<p><small class="grey">Popping his head into her office, the boss said, “Let’s make two copies of all the paperwork.” 
<small class="grey">	“I’m sorry, two copies?” she mirrored in response, remembering not only the DJ voice, but to deliver the mirror in an inquisitive tone.
<small class="grey">	“Yes,” her boss responded, “one for us and one for the customer.”</small></small></small></p>

<p><small class="grey">“I’m sorry, so you are saying that the client is asking for a copy and we need a copy for internal use?”</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">“Actually, I’ll check with the client—they haven’t asked for anything. But I definitely want a copy. That’s just how I do business.”</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">“Absolutely,” she responded. “Thanks for checking with the customer. Where would you like to store the in-house copy? There’s no more space in the file room here.”</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">“It’s fine. You can store it anywhere,” he said, slightly perturbed now. “Anywhere?” she mirrored again, with calm concern. When another person’s tone of voice or body language is inconsistent with his words, a good mirror can be particularly useful.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">In this case, it caused her boss to take a nice, long pause—something he did not often do. My student sat silent. “As a matter of fact, you can put them in my office,” he said, with more composure than he’d had the whole conversation. “I’ll get the new assistant to print it for me after the project is done. For now, just create two digital backups.”</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">A day later her boss emailed and wrote simply, “The two digital backups will be fine.” 
A week of work avoided!”</small></p>

<h3 id="show-empathy-by-labeling">Show Empathy by Labeling:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Labeling is acknowledging your counterpart’s situation. Making them feel understood, soothes them sub consciously,  making them feel conformable with you and improves the odds of a better deal for you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should start with “It seems like …” or “It sounds like…” or “It looks like…” and tell the counterpart what you have understood their situation to be. You are showing empathy here. Never start with an “I” as in “I think”, because it gets people’s guard up. If label done right, it makes the other party feel understood and diffuses their tension.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use it either to get a “that’s right” from others, which indicates that they acknowledged that you understood them, or use it to diffuse the tension of others.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example from the authors experience:</p>

<p><small class="grey"> The author was in a high tension situation, at least three heavily armed fugitives were reported to be inside 27th floor of a high rise. With phone number to call into the apartment, the author had to talk through the door</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> I used my late-night FM DJ voice. I didn’t give orders in my DJ voice, or ask what the fugitives wanted.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> Instead, I imagined myself in their place. “It looks like you don’t want to come out,” I said repeatedly. “It seems like you worry that if you open the door, we’ll come in with guns blazing. It looks like you don’t want to go back to jail.”</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> For six hours, we got no response. The FBI coaches loved my DJ voice. But was it working? And then, when we were almost completely convinced that no one was inside, a sniper on an adjacent building radioed that he saw one of the curtains in the apartment move.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> The front door of the apartment slowly opened. A woman emerged with her hands in front of her.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> I continued talking. All three fugitives came out. None of them said a word until we had them in handcuffs. Then I asked them the question that was most nagging me: Why did they come out after six hours of radio silence? Why did they finally give in?</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> All three gave me the same answer.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> “We didn’t want to get caught or get shot, but you calmed us down,” they said. “We finally believed you wouldn’t go away, so we just came out.”</small></p>

<h3 id="say-no-with-open-ended-questions">Say “No” with Open Ended Questions:</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation” - Robert Estabrook</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you had thought, how am I supposed to disagree without being disagreeable. Then it means you had known about it all along, you just didnt know that you already know. Confusing isn’t it. The answer lies in the question itself. Instead of saying “No” explicitly, you ask an open ended question like “How am I supposed to do that”. With just one question, your problem has also become your counterpart’s problem. The open question makes the counterpart to think what they just offered for you. All this without saying an explicit no. Amazing isn’t it. Whereas when asked a Yes/No question, the counterpart blurts out a subconscious answer without needing to think much.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should always ask open ended questions starting with “How” and “What”. “Why” is excluded from the list because it is not always suitable for every conversation, but can be used occasionally when necessary.  And as always <strong>tone matters</strong>, your tone should be like you are genuinely seeking your counterpart’s help to find a solution for your problem.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><small class="grey"> Here is an example to illustrate this:
Once a patient admitted to a hospital was dissatisfied with something and tried to storm out of his room. And the hospital staff couldn’t calm him down. When the doctor came, instead of saying a “No”, the doctor asked, “What do you hope to achieve by going”. By asking an open ended question, the doctor implicitly forced the patient to calm down and explain his situation, without sounding hostile</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> To give you another example, a small public relation firm for a big corporation was not getting paid by their client. The client always managed to evade paying on the promise of repeat business, stating it will result eventually in large revenue. But the firm hadn’t been paid a single penny. So the author advised the firm’s head to summarize their situation and ask “How am I supposed to do that?”. Even though she was skeptical, She practised and did what the author asked her to do. To her surprise, her client said “You’re right, you can’t and I apologize.” Her client explained that they were going through some internal problems, but agreed to pay within 2 days.</small></p>

<h4 id="elegant-ways-to-say-no">Elegant Ways To Say No:</h4>

<p>Generally, you can say “No” four times before you have to say the actual word. Learn how to pull this off from an excerpt taken off the book,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The first step in the “No” series is the old standby: “How am I supposed to do that?” You have to deliver it in a deferential way, so it becomes a request for help.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After that, some version of “Your offer is very generous, I’m sorry, that just doesn’t work for me” is an elegant second way to say “No.” The “I’m sorry” also softens the “No” and builds empathy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Then you can use something like “I’m sorry but I’m afraid I just can’t do that.” It’s a little more direct, and the “can’t do that” does great double duty. By expressing an inability to perform, it can trigger the other side’s empathy toward you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“I’m sorry, no” is a slightly more succinct version for the fourth “No.” If delivered gently, it barely sounds negative at all. If you have to go further, of course,</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>“No” is the last and most direct way. Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection and a tone of regard; it’s not meant to be “NO!”</p>

<h3 id="getting-a-no-at-the-beginning-is-good">Getting a “No” (at the beginning) is Good:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>When you get a call from a salesperson, you get your guard up and you become dismissive even before hearing their proposition. A trained salesperson will mostly follow a script to get a yes from you. They follow a series of scripted questions which will start with an obvious question aiming to get a Yes from you, then moving on gradually to the actual sales question. The problem with this script is that it is trying  too hard to get a yes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a water purifier seller had called you and asked “Do you want to drink healthy water”, All you would want to do is shout a big No, end the call and carry on with your work. Well, the moment you sensed that was a sales call, he had a “No” waiting in your mouth. When you know the salesperson is trying to force an yes out of you, you go to defensive mode. you don’t let most of the words into your brain. If the offer terms never reaches the other person’s CPU, then how will you ever get a deal made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That’s why the author says its best to get a “No” at the beginning rather than trying to force a “Yes”. Instead of asking “Do you have time to talk?” you can ask “Is it a good time to talk?”. You get a “No” and their complete focus</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Making the person say “No” lowers down their guard, and they would start listen to your offer. Saying “No” subconsciously gives them the sense of control. It makes them available to listen. This not only works for the sales pitch, it can also be used in any form of negotiations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see an example from the book,</p>

<p><small class="grey">FUND-RAISER: Hello, can I speak with Mr. Smith?</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">MR. SMITH: Yes, this is he.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">FUND-RAISER: I’m calling from the XYZ Committee, and I wanted to ask you a few important questions about your views on our economy today. Do you feel that if things stay the way they are, America’s best days are ahead of it?</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">MR. SMITH: No, things will only get worse.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">FUND-RAISER: Are you going to sit and watch President Obama take the White House in November without putting up a fight?</small></p>

<p><small class="grey">MR. SMITH: No, I’m going to do anything I can to make sure that doesn’t happen.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> FUND-RAISER: If you want do something today to make sure that doesn’t happen, you can give to XYZ Committee, which is working hard to fight for you.</small></p>

<p><small class="grey"> The “No”-oriented script got a 23 percent better rate of return in comparison to “Yes” oriented script.</small></p>

<h3 id="anchor-the-mindset">Anchor the Mindset:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before giving bad news or revealing your exact offer, you have to first anchor their expectation down. You make them expect the worst news and hit them with bad news. This will look positive to them, as the information they received wasn’t as bad as they thought it would be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Let’s see how the author delivered bad news to a set of contractors, who on average were paid $2000 per day, can be paid only $500 a day.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><small class="grey"> I knew exactly what they would do if I just told them straight out: they’d laugh me out of town. So I got each of them on the phone and hit them hard with an accusation audit. “I got a lousy proposition for you,” I said, and paused until each asked me to go on. “By the time we get off the phone, you’re going to think I’m a lousy businessman. You’re going to think I can’t budget or plan. You’re going to think Chris Voss is a big talker. His first big project ever out of the FBI, he screws it up completely. He doesn’t know how to run an operation. And he might even have lied to me.” And then, once I’d anchored their emotions in a minefield of low expectations, I played on their loss aversion. “Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you before I took it to someone else,” I said. Suddenly, their call wasn’t about being cut from $2,000 to $500 but how not to lose $500 to some other guy. Every single one of them took the deal. No counteroffers, no complaints. Now, if I hadn’t anchored their emotions low, their perception of $500 would have been totally different. If I’d just called and said, “I can give you $500 per day. What do you think?” they’d have taken it as an insult and slammed down the phone.</small></p>

<p>In this example,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Did you notice how the author starts by saying bad things about himself? Why did he say such things? Because it is important to focus, not only on what would help you complete a deal, but also to focus on what might hinder the deal and take care of it. If the author hadn’t said such things, the contractors would have said it which would build the tension further, but the author cleverly took the sting and started with how they would possibly reject. Starting with what the counterpart could use to disagree with you, reduces its effect and makes it less of a barrier in deal negotiation. It also does the job of anchoring here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also, the author exploits the fear of missing out by saying “Still, I wanted to bring this opportunity to you <em>before I took it to someone else</em>,” By referring that the opportunity can go to others, the Author lures them to go on with the deal by triggering their fear of missing out. Is there any other human tendency which might come in handy in future? Yes, there are!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Certainty Effect - People are drawn towards sure things over probabilities, even though the probability is a better choice</li>
      <li>Loss Aversion - People take greater risk to avoid a loss than to achieve gain</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="salary-or-price-negotiation">Salary (or Price) Negotiation:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is generally better to <strong>let the other side start</strong>. If you hadn’t done your homework, you might ask for a salary well below the market standard. For example, once a Novelist was approached to write a story for a Hollywood movie, he accepted to write and asked for a salary of $150 per week (this is in 1944). While the producer had already planned to pay him $750 per week. If he had let the producer go first, then the novelist could have got 5 times what he had wanted. Luckily the produce took pity on him and called an agent to represent the Novelist during negotiations. It may not be the case for you, remember life is unfair (to those who are unprepared)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Letting the other side start also has a disadvantage. The counterpart might start with an anchor, offering well below market average. You should be psychologically ready to tackle the anchor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you are forced to reveal your price first, then you can start with something like this “At top places like X Corp, people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000”. You get the benefit of not revealing your price and also you get to anchor the counter part’s mindset by saying the highest salary range possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establish a <strong>range</strong> - You are more likely to get what you wanted if you name your price in a range, with the lowest end being what you actually wanted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use <strong>Odd numbers</strong> more. For example, when you offer something like $37,352,  it would feel more like a well thought out proposition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the deal you are offered is not up to your expectation, you can also ask something which benefits you without affecting counterpart. For example, you can ask for ** non-monetary** items in the salary negotiation, like asking for more paid holidays. In the book, the author gives an example where the author accepted to talk in Bar Association for a very low fee when they offered to feature him on the front page of the Bar magazine. The association offered something valuable to the author with no extra effort from their side. The magazine had to feature someone on the front page, this way both sides got what they wanted</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In price negotiation, you can always benefit by knowing counterpart’s <strong>deadline</strong>. For example, A car salesperson will have a quarterly target, so you are more likely to get steep discounts just before the quarter ends. Your counterpart could try to use the same tactics to get a better deal from you, but don’t give in to that. Remember deadlines are always flexible, you can always postpone deadlines without major negative repercussions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At any time, if the negotiation is not going in the direction you wanted, you can always take a detour by saying “Lets put the price off to aside for a moment and talk about what would make this a good deal” or “What else would you be able to offer to make that a good price for me?”. You can you use the same when the counterpart has put in big anchor in front of you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I know this has been a lengthy (and hopefully informative) read so far, Let’s see a final example incorporating most of what you have learnt today,</p>

<p><small class="grey"> It was a desperate situation, because Farouq, a Georgetown MBA student, needed $600 to hold big alumni event in Dubai and MBA Dean was his last stop. At the meeting, Farouq told the dean about how excited the students were about the trip and how beneficial it would be for the Georgetown MBA brand in the region. Before he could even finish, the dean jumped in. “Sounds like a great trip you guys are planning,” she said. “But money is tight and I could authorize no more than $300.” <strong>[Anchor against you]</strong> Farouq hadn’t expected the dean to go so quickly. But things don’t always go according to plan. “That is a very generous offer given your budget limits, but I am not sure how that would help us achieve a great reception for the alums in the region,” Farouq said, acknowledging her limits but <strong>saying no without using the word</strong>. Then he dropped an extreme <strong>anchor</strong>. “I have a very high amount in my head: $1,000 is what we need.” As expected, the extreme anchor quickly knocked the dean off her limit. “That is severely out of my range and I am sure I can’t authorize that. However, I will give you $500.” Farouq was half-tempted to fold—being $100 short wasn’t make-or-break—but he remembered the curse of aiming low. He decided to push forward. The $500 got him closer to the goal but not quite there, he said; $850 would work. The dean replied by saying that she was already giving more than what she wanted and $500 was reasonable. At this point, if Farouq had been less prepared he would have given up, but he was ready for the punches. “I think your offer is very reasonable <strong>[Second “No”]</strong> and I understand your restrictions, but I need more money to put on a great show for the school,” he said. “How about $775?” The dean smiled, and Farouq knew he had her. “You seem to have a specific number in your head that you are trying to get to,” she said. “Just tell it to me.” At that point Farouq was happy to give her his number as he felt she was sincere. “I need $737.50 <strong>[Odd number]</strong> to make this work and you are my last stop,” he said. She laughed. The dean then praised him for knowing what he wanted and said she’d check her budget. Two days later, Farouq got an email saying her office would put in $750.</small></p>

<h3 id="outro">Outro:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To sum up, Negotiation is not a showdown of two person trying to prove their dominance to each other, instead it is the process of extracting information from your counterpart as much as possible, understanding them and giving a slight hidden push to move their thought process towards where you want them to be. By asking correct questions in a calm pleasant tone and showing empathy, you make your counterpart to think what you want them to think.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proper tone, body language, giving proper pause is also as essential as the techniques which you had seen today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There is lots of information to take in here, instead of trying out all techniques at once, practice and trial with one technique at a time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Also not all the points can be used in a single conversation. So don’t force yourself to use every technique you remember, thinking somehow it will give you a hidden advantage. it will only break the flow of the conversation. So use only when necessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And one more thing, reading this doesn’t make u magically better in negotiation, practising this will!</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>Revisiting the books you had finished earlier helps to refresh your learning and you could also infer new points from the book, which you couldn’t get before, because of your then comprehension level. So I have planned to revisit the books I had read and for better digesting my learning, I have decided to share the learning with you so that it benefits you and myself.</p>

<p>Darren Hardy’s Linkedin page describes himself as a “Success Mentor to CEOs and High-Achievers, New York Times Bestselling Author and Former Publisher/Editor of SUCCESS Magazine”. In this book, Darren shares how to make your life better, what steps you need to follow to form good habits, how you can save more and how to make your relationship better etc. And the book is filled with several incidents from his life as examples. Enough about the book, let’s delve into the summary,</p>

<h2 id="compound-effect">Compound effect</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Small, Smart Choices + Consistency + Time = RADICAL DIFFERENCE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The author explains the compounding effect with this example “What’s simple to do is also simple not to do. The magic is not in the complexity of the task; the magic is in the doing of simple things repeatedly and long enough to ignite the miracle of the Compound Effect. So, beware of neglecting the simple things that make the big things in your life possible”. Do you want to get big fat positive results in life? then incorporate some good habits (however small) in life <em>starting today</em>. The benefits of these habits will get compounded eventually and give the results you wanted.</p>

<p>Sadly, bad habits get compounded too, Darren explains this with a plane travelling from Los Angeles to New York “If the nose of the plane is pointed only 1 per cent off course—almost an invisible adjustment when the plane’s sitting on the tarmac in Los Angeles—it will ultimately end up about 150 miles off course”. Similarly, a single poor habit, which doesn’t look like much at the moment, can ultimately lead you miles off course from the direction of your goals.</p>

<p>Since the compounding of a bad habit is very bad, the ideal thing would be to kick out all the bad habits from your life. But it is nearly impossible to live without any bad habits (even some may find life without bad habits, a bit boring). So to cancel the compounding of a bad habit which you couldn’t remove from your life, nullify its effect with some good habit. For example, instead of trying to stop eating junk foods for the rest of life to prevent obesity and heart problem, I would suggest to cancel its effect with exercise.</p>

<h2 id="take-100-responsibility">Take 100% responsibility</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You alone are responsible for what you do, don’t do, or how you respond to what’s done to you”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When u take 100% responsibility for everything, life becomes simple. Nothing can affect your tranquillity. “If you’ve ever blamed traffic for being late, or decided you are in a bad mood because of something your kid, spouse, or co-worker did, you’re not taking 100 per cent personal responsibility. You arrived late because the printer was busy? Maybe you shouldn’t have waited until the last minute? Co-worker messed up the presentation? Shouldn’t you have double-checked it yourself before delivering it?”.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s easy to point fingers at others, isn’t it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At a glance, it can look like other’s mistake, but it’s you who failed to see that coming, so just take up responsibility and don’t let it repeat.</p>

<h2 id="track">Track!</h2>
<p>If you want to get better at something then start tracking it. Want some extra free time? Note down and analyse how you spend your time each day, there would be some activity which would be sucking up ur time but gives out no benefit, find it and remove it out of the equation. These time-killing activities would have been in your plain sight all along yet still hidden from you somehow, tracking helps you find such things. The same goes for money. In the book, the author states an example of how he made his assistant write all her spending, to find a way to increase her savings. Turned out she was spending more money on Starbucks coffee, instead, buying Starbucks coffee beans and making own coffee was more economical. And similarly her spending on outside food, cable was replaced with economical alternatives. Thanks to tracking and analysing, her saving got increased without a substantial lifestyle change. This is why the author says tracking is his go-to transformation model for everything that ails him.</p>

<p> Tracking also helps in measuring your performance. It helps you to find out whether you are doing something right or not.  You can track your habits, exercise, sleep time, food or anything in life. Depending on whats ur requirement, start tracking, review the data and find a solution.</p>

<h2 id="routine">Routine</h2>
<p>The author suggests having a routine to follow before and after the bed makes his life easier and better.</p>

<p>Every morning he gets up at 5 am,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thinks about all the things he is grateful for</li>
  <li>Next, he sends love to anyone person (could be friend, relative or someone he met in a supermarket) in his life by imagining all he wish and hope for them.</li>
  <li>Then he decides on three things which he would do in the day to bring him closer to his goal, followed by coffee and stretching.</li>
  <li>After which he sits on his recliner and go through positive instructional content for 30mins.</li>
  <li>Next, he takes 15mins to glance through his top three, one-year and five-year goals, quarterly objectives, top goals for week, month. Then decides on the top three “Most Valuable priorities” (MVP) which he should do that day that would take him closer to these goals. Only then, he checks his mail and starts working on his MVPs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before going to bed,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Darren reviews his day, he compares his plan for the day with how well he executed them, whether something needs to be carry forwarded to the next day’s plan or not.</li>
  <li>Then he notes down his learning, insight of the day in his journal</li>
  <li>At last, he finishes his day by reading 10 pages of inspirational content</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This routine may look like a lot, but the key is to start small then scale large, so you can try following one or two activity, then try to add further to the routine as you grow</em>. The author says “ All hell can break loose throughout the day, but because I control the bookends, I know I am always going to start and finish strong”. 
Also, Darren says he keeps his life interesting by following a routine of indulging in some adventurous activity once every month.</p>

<h2 id="take-action-">Take action 👊🏻</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Knowledge without action leads to Self delusion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indulging only in learning but not taking action is one of the most common mistakes by people trying to improve themselves. Reading tons of books (without any action) gives you a fake sense of growth due to all the dopamine you got with reading, but eventually, you realize ur life has been the same, with no improvement.  You already know what u want in life and how to achieve it, So stop reading and start working towards your goal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reading makes you better, but reading alone is not sufficient to achieve your goals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When you start taking actions, setting the proper target date for it is a must (learn about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson’s law</a> before fixing any date). Set clear, measurable goals, not generic ones. Don’t set your goal as “I want to be rich”, instead set it as “I should have saved ___ amount by xx/yy/zzzz”. This is a clear goal which has defined target date and easily measurable. A goal without a deadline is never going to be achieved, so don’t even think to work on a goal without a deadline.</p>

<p>Let me give example on how having a deadline is important, Blogging is my leisure activity, so I don’t force a deadline on myself (which reflects on my rate of publishing). During the preparation of this article I faced many reasons to drop writing this article like I got busy in my job, my health was not good for some time.  Also, I had set a concrete timeline (Oct 10) to finish this article, and this acted as my push, I didn’t want to break my goal and this forced me to stick to the goal. So I can tell you one thing, if I hadn’t set my deadline, I would have just dropped this article and would have said to myself that I can write this some other time.</p>

<p>The author goes one step further and suggests to share the target date with the public (via social media or any other medium) when you commit something in front of everyone, the chances of you backing out from the commitment becomes very less.</p>

<h2 id="drops-of-wisdom-from-the-book">Drops of Wisdom from the book:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Once-dominant empires have failed for this very reason. People get to a certain level of success and get too comfortable.</li>
  <li>All of the hows will be meaningless until your whys are powerful enough. Until you’ve set your desire and motivation in place, you’ll abandon any new path you seek to better your life.</li>
  <li> You say your family is your top priority, but if they don’t appear on your busy calendar, they aren’t, really.</li>
  <li>About every three months, I pick one vice and abstain for thirty days (this probably stems from my Catholic Lent upbringing). I love proving to myself that I’m still in charge. Try this yourself. Pick a vice—something you do in moderation, but you know doesn’t contribute to your highest good—and take yourself on a thirty-day wagon run.</li>
  <li>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said so eloquently: “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge.”</li>
  <li>My current “accountability partner” is my good friend Landon Taylor. As I mentioned before, we have a thirty-minute call every Friday to discuss our weekly wins, losses, fixes, “ah-has,” and where we are on our growth plans. The anticipation of the call and knowing I have to be accountable to Landon keeps me extra committed throughout the week.</li>
  <li>Find the line of expectation and then exceed it.</li>
</ul>
